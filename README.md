# Hedgehog The Drug Dog

## Hedgehog The Drug Dog is a single-player puzzle game written for the COSMAC VIP.

The objective of the game is to find the drug mule by matching the smell of the drugs with
the smell of the people moving through security.

Hedgehog can sniff people by moving next to them. Some smells emanate naturally.
When Hedgehog thinks he has the suspect, he can bark, alerting his handler.
Will you find the drug mule?

WASD to move. Q to bark.
30 cycles per frame easy mode. 100 cycles per frame hard mode.
*For the drug warriors, a word from a dog is enough.*
